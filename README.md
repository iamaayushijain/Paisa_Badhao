A Woman's best safety is a bit of money of her own.

APP VISION

PAISA BADHAO is an app that visions to make RURAL women INDEPENDENT and STRONGER by making them FINANCIALLY literate. The app gives them finance LESSONS, TRACK savings, CONTACT higher authorities and also learn MATHEMATICS.

UX DESIGN

The UX design of an app should be Useful, Usable, Equitable and Enjoyable. Keeping this in mind and our target audience being Rural Women, we plan to make the app in both english and Hindi language. Moreover a very simple format and buttons are used so that the non tech savvy users can use the app easily. 

Most of the app features work well without an internet connection as well which makes it apt for people living in remote areas. 

After a thorough primary research, one important point was highlighted that rural women being unaware of the basic terms of finances and not knowing mathematics were generally ignored and bullied when they visited regional banks. hence our app gives short lessons and also quizzes users on Finance terms and basic mathematics. 

TOOLS USED

The app Paisa Badhao is made in MIT App Inventor 2.0 which is a no code app builder. The apk file for the project has been attached in the google form and the AIA FILE of the project which includes the SOURCE file has also been attached in this github repository.

The working of the app can be checked using the apk file and the aia file can be used to take a look at the source code. The code cannot be exported in the form of Java or any other programming language, it has to be viewed using MIT APP Inventor 2.0 which is an online easy to use platform to build apps.

We have taken the first step towards making a change in the society using technology and now its your decison to give us a chance forward.
